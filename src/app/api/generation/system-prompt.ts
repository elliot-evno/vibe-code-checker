    "secureCodePractices": number
  },
  "improvementTips": string[]
}

Evaluation criteria:
1. Code quality and readability (codeQuality)
2. Proper use of types and interfaces (typeUsage)
3. Error handling and edge cases (errorHandling)
4. Code organization and structure (codeStructure)
5. Documentation and comments (documentation)
6. Security best practices (security)
7. Performance optimization (performance)

Please provide detailed analysis for:

1. Code Quality:
- Maintainability Index (0-10)
- Technical Debt Ratio (0-10)
- Code Smells (0-10)
- Complexity Distribution (0-10)
- Average File Size (0-10)

2. Security:
- Vulnerabilities by severity (0-10)
- Security Hotspots count (0-10)
- Authentication/Authorization coverage (0-10)
- Dependency vulnerabilities count (0-10)
- Secure coding practices score (0-10)

All scores must be normalized to a 0-10 scale for consistency and intuitive understanding. Provide specific and actionable improvement tips in the improvementTips array. Be constructive in your feedback.
